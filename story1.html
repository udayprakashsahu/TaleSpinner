          A story about the last time I see one of my friends. In an unexpected turn of events, the reader finds that this might be the last time they see one of their friends.
          DUBAI IS ON!!!!
          HELLO.
          IF I DO THIS..WILL I GET THE MONEY?
          YES. YOU WILL.
          WHEN DO I HAVE TO START THE WORK?
          NOW!
          
          My name is Amar. I am living with my Aunt. She is the only one I have and had. This is my school and by no means it can be said a normal one. Our school was built on the funds of big builders.
          So our school has all types of students in it nerds, weirdos, rich kids who come by their Ferrari and then have a fight outside the school and break all mirrors. Alcoholics who flood the entire washrooms with liquors...
          ...By that I mean IT’S CRAZY OUT HERE!
          I guess I am the normal one here. I have very few friends and in that few friends I got the one who is always at my back-Anthony!
          Recently our school announced a trip. A TRIP TO DUBAI.
          Everyone was excited except me as I know that it was not possible for me to afford. Anthony rejected to go as I was not going. I was sorry for him.
          
          BUT THEN ONE DAY-
          I was told that Alam wants to meet me.
          
          He was the leader of the school gang. Everyone of that group was under him no matter how rich they were. He was very strong and jacked. Once he had a fight with a student and now that student has lost 2 teeths. He was scary for everyone.
          
          I was having lunch with Anthony and then I saw the crowd disappearing around us as he head towards us. I was in surprise and so was everyone around me. Everyone stopped their talking and whispering. There was silence. He stood in front of me and then I got up and looked towards him.
          
          Hi Alam..you have something up?
          YES I DO.
          What’s that?
          I heard you are not going to the Dubai trip right?
          No I am not.
          And how could you? YOU BROOKIE!! (the whole gang laughed and I was flat with no expressions)
          So listen now I have a deal for you...
          WHAT’S THAT?
          
          If you do my work I will pay for your trip and then you two fools can have the lifetime experience in Dubai which in other case you can never even think of and of course don’t tell your Aunt about it else she will have a heart attack!!!!
          
          What do you want me to do?
          I want you to do my three tasks.
          AT first I want you to beat a student for me which is of the other school and by beating I mean a real one which if you insist I can show you right now.
          And second one I want you to deliver my parcel to an address.
          And last I want you to go to my girl’s house and create a scene or do something so that I can sneak into her room and then get out later.
          
          And if you did all these tasks I am going to keep my promise.
          It’s a very nice deal think about it and tell me later.
          LET’S GO BOYS.
          So..what do you say Anthony?
          Say what?
          About that offer?
          Are you out of your mind? Don’t even think about taking up the work because once you take it up ..there is no coming back from it.
          IS IT?
          Yeah.
          Listen I have all the information gather.
          
          The first task where you have to beat that guy from other school his name is Surya. He is the son one of the big builders of the city and his reputation in school is same as that of Alam. He is the group leader of his school gang. If you lay a single hand on him you are dead. There are 30 men for his backup at anytime.
          And the second - the stuff which he told you to deliver is most probably drugs or god knows what? In other sense it’s smuggling.
          And the third which I came to know about his girlfriend is that her father is a politician and there is very tight security in her house if you do anything stupid it’s game over.
          I SEE…
          Yeah you better go home and sleep peacefully and don’t think about all this. We both are fine here!!! We will go as usual to our same tea stall place and chill. You don’t need to worry about it or even think about going into it!!
          
          Okay Anthony. I WILL NOT GO!
          I am here, always!
          (THE NEXT DAY)
          HELLO.
          IF I DO THIS..WILL I GET THE MONEY?
          YES. YOU WILL.
          WHEN DO I HAVE TO START THE WORK?
          NOW!
          
          But I have a condition I want my payment as soon as I complete the tasks. I want no delay at all.
          Alright! I am impressed!!! I promise as soon as you do all the things I told you without fail I am going to transfer the money. I am a man of my words.
          Okay.
          Start soon you have less time left with you.
          
          I am going to beat that guy Surya outside his coaching center. His friends will not be there and that’s the time after his coaching he is all alone. That’s the only chance I have.
          It’s started to rain heavily… There he is with an umbrella.
          I CAN’T DO THIS… I AM SORRY!
          [REM-…..YOU BROOKIE…IF YOU DO THIS…..YOU BOTH CAN GO!!! …I WILL GIVE YOU THE MONEY IF YOU DO IT!! COME ON… NICE DEAL..]
          I went towards him from behind and tapped him on his shoulders as he turned back. I gave him one punch on his nose and the umbrella fall down. Then I gave my knees in his stomach and two punches on his face. He was unable to defend!!! Then I dragged him and pushed him on the road filled with water. Then I started to beat him down with my legs. He started to bleed and that’s it I could not go further.
          
          The water there started to turn into red color! He was lying down with rain drops falling on his face and I saw people seeing us from distance. I looked towards him but I had no choice I guess he was no different from them.
          I turned back for my second task now…
          
          I HOPE THIS RAIN TO GO AWAY.
          
          Tonight is the last day to finish the tasks. I was late! The parcel which he gave to deliver where actual Drugs. Anthony was right I guess. But I can’t go back now.
          
          HERE is the place where I have to give this away. I think there he comes. That guy in hoodie… he is the guy to whom I have to deliver it...
          ……That’s !  it! I think I just did it.
          May I go now?
          No!
          Excuse me?
          (Uncovering the hoodie….IT WAS SURYA!!!!!!)
          HAAA!!! SURPRISE!!!
          
          I tried to run away but then I was surrounded by 30 men all around me!! I was blank!! I have nowhere to go now.
          He gave me 2 punches on my faces and then a kick on my lower part.
          I was down with huge pain and then he grabbed my face and told-
          What did you think you scum? You are Alam’s pet, right? And what you did yesterday was the worst mistake of your life. HOW DARE YOU EVEN TOUCH ME? (continuous beatings…I was coughing blood)
          We found out it was you and we came to know that you will come out of the hole only to deliver this shit here. You know what, this area comes under my control and I am the head of this business here. That’s why Alam sent you and now you can see where you are…
          Let’s hang him here upside down what do you say?
          Naaa.. let us all kick him.. and trash his head in that garbage..
          I was on my knees looking at him. I thought this is it!
          Surya placed a hockey stick on my head and then swung it back with full force to HIT………………………………………..
          POLICE SIREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          
          Everyone was in shock! From where did police come up? One guy went to confirm it. They were actual police coming for us. I think they got to know about all this. There was chaos all over. Everyone started to leave the place with their bikes until they came to know that the police have already surrounded the front gate.
          I was still there… struggling to get up! BUT then I got an idea. I told Surya- HEY!!! You guys come with me! I know a shortcut from here to escape or else we all are screwed for a lifetime!
          
          He agreed! I went towards my bike and started it!
          JUST FOLLOW ME GUYS WHERE I AM GOING NO ONE WILL STOP NO MATTER WHAT! JUST FOLLOW ME!
          All of us were on our bikes and the police were chasing us!
          I was directing them until we came closer to Alam’s girlfriend - ESHA’S house!!
          I can see the open gate with security guards all around! There was a huge lawn and the house was massive!!! I told them not to stop and they have nowhere to go as well! The security guards saw the chaos coming with 30 men on bikes and 5 police cars from behind with full speed marching towards the house. By seeing this, everyone there was in panic and started to close the main door and then ….
          Hey AMAR what to do now?? JUST DO AS I SAY NOW.
          We all made a small formation pattern with our bikes and blocked the view of the police car behind us and marched towards the gate with full speed !!! and then as we got very close to the gate half of us
          Drifted our bikes to the left and half to the right. As the reaction time for the car behind us was less it went straight to the gate .. breaking it through and the gate went flying ..
          But then we were blocked by the other police cars which were behind us ..
          
          The police were asking us to get out of our bikes and surrender.
          DAMN!! I GOT SO CLOSE TO COMPLETE THIS TASK!...NO!!
          But then .. suddenly it was all dark .. everywhere. I think fortune was on my side now. The electricity was gone all over the place with no backup! EVERYONE Screamed-
          RUN….RUN…everyone left their bikes and ran into the house .. there were guards, policemen, workers, people all over colliding with each other. IT WAS ALL CHAOSTIC! NO ONE WAS ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING CLEARLY.
          I had already called Alam to sneak into Esha’s room from behind the house as no one is there as of now. He was able to reach there-
          Hello ESHA!!!
          Hey.. what the.. how did you reach here?
          As I told you I can complete each dare you can give. I beat that Surya guy who flirted with you and I delivered that parcel for your politician father! And now I am here. So now I can get what I want, right?
          Yes.. I guess.
          (phone rings)
          Hey Alam’s it's me! (noises all over …)
          YEAH!! As I said I am giving you the money right now… did you get?
          YES! I GOT IT!
          FINE now don’t call me again I am in between something!!
          We were running all around the house breaking the furniture, lamps, smashing the tables, screaming etc. The police were in the house as well and then we ran to the first floor..
          Hey Alam stop!! I can hear some noises, please go and check.
          Come on who is it ?? let me see..
          As Alam went outside he collided with Surya and some of his gang members. They recognized him and started beating him in the dark.
          
          The police thought that they were other policemen beating those guys so they also joined the club and started to beat Alam with their sticks. Alam was screaming in the dark but it was in vain.
          Meanwhile, I escaped from other policemen and guards and ran into a room. And then I heard a voice-
          You are back? I was scared here all alone in the dark. .. come here
          She grabbed me and pushed me to the walls and then held my face and kissed me on my lips!!! Before I could say anything.
          She started kissing me all over the face and then stripped herself up!
          Then she started to remove my clothes until her father came to the room-
          ESHA!! Are you alright?
          Yes papa I am fine.
          Okay stay here only and be careful we have got some problems down there. Electricity will come soon don’t worry!!! we are here
          Okay!!!(it was completely dark so no one was able to see anything it was as if we were only talking to the darkness here)
          
          Okay so… Alam run away! we will meet tomorrow!! As of now just get away or else it will be a huge problem.(then she hugged me..)
          I sneaked from the back of the house from where Alam came.
          Esha’s father went to his room and picked a rifle and shot it in the air! Everyone was scared and they all rush outside the house, some from behind, some jumped over the walls and picked their bikes and left. Alam somehow dragged himself outside the house. In the meantime, the electricity was back.
          
          The house was in complete disorder. Esha’s father talked with the police and resolved the matter as that parcel was ultimately his.
          
          Hey Anthony??.
          So this is the whole story. I completed the tasks and now I can go to Dubai! Aren’t you excited we both can go now? Are you angry with me?
          Amar, actually the thing is I was the one stopping you from doing all this throughout. I am sorry. Actually, it was me who unknowingly called the police to stop you from doing the task and then when I got the information that you have reached Esha’s house it was me who cut the entire house electricity!!! I am really sorry (crying…)
          But why would you do that?
          I did not want us to go to Dubai! Actually, I heard Alam in the washroom talking to his friends that he is just giving you the money not only to complete his tasks but
          
          BUT….
          AS NOW, I AM SAYING THIS IS MY PROMISE.
